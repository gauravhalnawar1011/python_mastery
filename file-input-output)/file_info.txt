# Random Access Memory (RAM) is volatile, meaning all its contents are lost once the program terminates. 
# To persist (store) data permanently, we use files.
#
# A file is simply data stored on a storage device. 
# A Python program can interact with files by reading from them or writing to them. 
#
# Volatile memory = temporary (data is erased when power is off, e.g., RAM).  
# Non-volatile memory = permanent storage (HDD, SSD, pendrive, SD card). 
# In RAM, data is only temporarily loaded while a program is running. 
#
# Types of files:
# 1. Text files (.txt, .csv, .py, etc.)
# 2. Binary files (.jpg, .dat, .exe, etc.)


# ðŸ“‚ Text vs Binary Files in Python

# Text Files:
# - Stores data in human-readable characters (UTF-8, ASCII, etc.)
# - Examples: .txt, .csv, .py, .html
# - When to use: Saving logs, configs, source code, simple structured data
#
# Binary Files:
# - Stores data in machine-readable format (0s and 1s)
# - Examples: .jpg, .png, .mp3, .exe, .dat
# - When to use: Images, audio, video, compiled programs, custom formats

# ðŸ”‘ Key Difference:
# Text files = human-readable âœ…
# Binary files = machine-readable âš¡
