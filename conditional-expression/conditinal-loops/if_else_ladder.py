# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b
 # if elif else ladder


a = 10

b = 200

if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
else:
    print("a is greater than b")
