# Assignment Operators
x = 5
x += 2  # x = x + 2 → 7
x -= 1  # x = x - 1 → 6
x *= 3  # x = x * 3 → 18
x /= 2  # x = x / 2 → 9.0
x %= 4  # x = x % 4 → 1.0



# Python Assignment Operators
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

# Operator	Example	Same As	Try it
# =	x = 5	x = 5	
# +=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
# -=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
# *=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
# /=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
# %=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
# //=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
# **=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
# &=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
# |=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
# ^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
# >>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
# <<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3	
# :=	print(x := 3)	x = 3
# print(x)	


a = 10

b = 10
